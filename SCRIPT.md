Now you have a repository for a portfolio (you haven't had the chance to customize it to be _your_ portfolio yet, but we'll get there) and you can browse the files -- anyone can browse the files.

This isn't a very exciting way to display your work. However, one of the features GitHub provides is the ability to host a publicly accessible website based on the contents of your repository. They call this feature **GitHub Pages** and we're going to see how to set that up now.

1.  Open your new repository in GitHub. You should see a button in the top right that says "Settings". Click that button.
